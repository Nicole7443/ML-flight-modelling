# Flight Modelling Project
By Nicole Thapa, Dharsaa Bhagudeva, Taylow Liew, Kathryn Percy-Robb, Harpreet Ghotra

This project was completed as the final project for MSCI 446: Introduction to Machine Learning 

- **Organization:** University of Waterloo  
- **Semester:** Winter 2024 (3A)

### Introduction

The purpose of this project is to assess classifications for flight cancellations and predict flight delays based on historical flight log data. The goal is to develop holistic models that accurately predict flight delay times and risk of cancellation by category to ensure consumers can make smarter flight decisions and help airports pre-plan flight schedulees or predict traffic. Additional analyses in this project include flight classification to detect flight abnormalities and overall flight duration prediction.
